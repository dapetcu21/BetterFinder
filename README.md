#BetterFinder
This is supposed to be a collection of small and lightweight hacks aimed to bring some sense into Finder.

Planned features:

* show hidden files and folders hotkey
* don't show hidden files on desktop
* cut and paste
* copy posix/terminal path to clipboard

If you have any more suggestions, don't hesitate to tell me.
